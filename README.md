grumblr is a maintenance tool originally created to fix long-standing
tumblr nuisances (such as no automatic tag page generation and
non-normalized case in tags, etc.).

## Basic usage

Right now grumblr is mostly for programmatic use, but it has a basic CLI:

```
$ pip install grumblr
$ python -m grumblr fetch blog_name
$ python -m grumblr report blog_name
```

Have fun grumblin!
